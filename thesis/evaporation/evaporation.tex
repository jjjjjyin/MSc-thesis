In order to study the effects of $N$, the first thing needed is to obtain very monodisperse samples with different $N$ values. This has been achieved through an evaporative purification technique, which has been practised on low molecular weight polystyrene, and proved to be an efficient way to obtain highly monodisperse polymers \cite{Zhu2017a}.

\section{Vapour pressure of PEO oligomers}

For a particular polymer, as its $N$ decreases, its vapour pressure increases, and for polymers with small enough $N$ values, their vapour pressure could be significant at high temperatures (lower than their thermal degradation temperature). This fact potentially allows one to separate polymer components with different $N$ values, by applying an evaporation method similar to distillation.

To examine the feasibility of separating components through evaporation, it is a good idea to first look at their vapour pressures. Unfortunately, there are few data of vapour pressure of pure PEO \cite{Krieger2018}, either from calculation or experimental measurements. Therefore, we applied a theoretical model to calculate the vapour pressures of low molecular weight PEO.

Sanchez and Lacombe's Lattice-Fluid Model \cite{Sanchez1976} describes a fluid using only three molecular parameters, and provides a method to calculate the relation between vapour pressure and temperature for a given $N$ value. These three parameters for PEO could be found in the literature \cite{Rodgers1993}.

In this model, Gibbs free energy G is a function of mass density $\rho$:

\begin{equation}
G = - \rho + P\nu + T[(\nu - 1)\ln(1 - \rho) + \dfrac{1}{r}\ln(\rho/\omega)]  \label{eqn_Gvsrho}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\rho$ is reduced density, $P$ is reduced pressure, $\nu$ is reduced volume, $T$ is reduced temperature, $r$ is the number of monomers in a polymer molecule, and $\omega = \delta r/\sigma e^{r-1}$ ($\delta$ is the flexible parameter, and $\sigma$ is the symmetry number). For a specific $N$ at given pressure and temperature, G could be plotted as a function of $\rho$ as shown below.

\end{figure}

The curve has two local minima. The first minimum represents the gas phase, with lower mass density, and the second minimum represents the liquid phase, with higher mass density. By tuning pressure or temperature, the two minima can be adjusted to be equal. This means the system has equal probability to be in the state of either gas or liquid. At a given temperature, there exists only one pressure that satisfies this equality, and this pressure and temperature are defined as the saturation pressure and temperature. The locus of all the saturation points represents the saturation/coexistence line, which is in fact the curve of vapour pressure as a function of temperature.

Solving Equation \ref{eqn_Gvsrho} and applying the three molecular parameters found in literature, we were able to calculate the vapour pressure curve for each $N$ value of PEO oligomers. The results are shown in the plot below, and note that each curve has been generated from 10-20 calculated points.

\end{figure}

The results for vapour pressures calculated from this model are not expected to be numerically correct, but they provides a good guidance in terms of the trend of vapour pressure curves and the gaps between neighbouring $N$'s. For a specific $N$, vapour pressure increases with temperature; for a specific temperature, vapour pressure decreases with $N$. More importantly, at a given temperature, the vapour pressures of two neighbouring $N$'s have a difference of up to two orders of magnitude. However, this difference gets smaller as temperature goes higher, which indicates that it would be increasingly difficult to achieve a perfect separation, and the purification products are expected to be more polydisperse under higher evaporation temperature. In addition, the comparison between vapour pressures of PS \cite{Zhu2017a} and PEO implies that it is harder to separate individual $N$'s of PEO, because the spacings among curves are narrower for PEO than for PS, and thus the evaporation products of PEO might not be as good as PS. Evaporation temperature should never get close to 533K \cite{Choukourov2009}, which is the critical temperature where PEO begins thermal degradation in vacuum.

\section{Evaporation technique and results}

The experimental setup for evaporative purification is generally the same as the setup used for polystyrene \cite{Zhu2017a}. 96 mg of neat PEO 600 g/mol sample is placed on top of a polished silicon wafer of 2 cm $\times$ 2 cm in size and 0.3 mm in thickness. The Si wafer acts as a bottom substrate and is placed onto a Linkam hot stage in a home-built vacuum chamber. In order to collect depositing fractions, another Si wafer of 5 cm $\times$ 5 cm in size is held approximately 3 mm directly above the neat material, by thermal insulating spacers.

Before the beginning of each evaporation period, the chamber is pumped down with a dry scroll pump to an initial pressure of around 0.3 mbar. After that, we flush the chamber with nitrogen, and then evacuate it again. This process is repeated several times to flush out oxygen in the chamber, so to prevent oxidation of the polymer. Three times of flushing leads to an oxygen level of approximately $4.7 \times 10^{-6}$ times the oxygen level in atomsphere. %calculated using -29.5 inhg lower than asmosphere.
Finally, we introduce a small amount of nitrogen into the chamber, until the pressure is raised to about 170 mbar. The reason for this action is because during the evaporation, the system requires a good thermal conduction to drive away excess heat from the hot stage, so to maintain a stable temperature (with a fluctuation of less than 1K) of the material.

We start the evaporation from 393K, and the evaporated material is collected every two hours. Products from the first four hours are not collected, as they may contain impurities such as initiators. We seal the product from each period into an aluminum sample pan, in preparation for future differential scanning calorimetry measurements and mass spectroscopy measurements.

Figure \ref{fig:massvstime} shows that within each temperature region during the evaporation, the mass of material collected experiences a general decreasing trend. The mass of products collected into sample pans from the top substrates ranges from 0.2 mg to 2.9 mg. We expected that small $N$'s would come off first, and as we increased the temperature, higher $N$'s would come off later. Therefore, the neat sample would get purified through separating different $N$'s.

\section{Results from mass spectroscopy}

To obtain information about the actual distribution of different $N$'s in each fraction, mass spectroscopy measurements were performed on several samples. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization â€“ time of flight (MALDI-TOF) technique was applied, with a Bruker Autoflex Speed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer to conduct the measurements.

A typical MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy measurement works with the following procedure:

\begin{itemize}
\item Mix the analyte (polymer sample in our case) with appropriate matrix material (dithranol in our case).
\item Bombard the mixed material with laser. The laser energy is absorbed by the matrix, which get desorbed and ionized, and a phase transition from solid to gas takes place in the matrix material.
\item A hot plume is generated, and during the flight of both the matrix material and the analyte, collisions among particles could result in the ionization of the analyte.
\item Ions flying into the the TOF mass spectrometer are separated due to different mass ($m$)-to-charge ($z$) ratios. With the same kinetic energy, lighter ions arrive at the detector earlier than heavier ions, according to the equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_MALDI}
\dfrac{m}{z} = \dfrac{2eUt^{2}}{L^{2}}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $e$ is the electron charge, $U$ is the voltage applied to create the electric field, $t$ is the time of flight, and $L$ is the path length.
\end{itemize}

From the spectrum generated, the exact distribution of molecular weights can be obtained, from which $M_{n}$, $M_{w}$, and PDI can be calculated.

\subsection{MALDI-TOF spectra and analysis}

MALDI measurements were carried out for 10 samples out of all the fractions, the neat PEO sample, and the leftover sample after all the evaporation periods. Figure \ref{fig:MALDIneat} is the spectrum of the neat sample, with $M_{n}$ and $M_{w}$ indicated by arrows on the plot. Figure \ref{fig:MALDIfractions} compares the purified fractions and shows the changes in molecular weight distribution during the evaporation process, with the green background spectrum being the neat sample.

\label{fig:MALDIfractions}
\end{figure}

As the evaporation temperature increases, the $N$ values of the PEO chains composing each fraction shift towards higher values, ranging from 8 to 16. With the intensity of each peak, we are able to calculate their $M_{n}$, $M_{w}$, and PDI, and make quantitative comparisons. Compared to the neat sample, the $N$ composition of the products are much narrower, meaning they are highly monodisperse. The lowest PDI of the products is calculated to be 1.0052, and $(PDI - 1)$ is around six times better compared to 1.0306 of the neat sample.

\subsection{Evolution of $N$ during evaporation process}

So far the distribution of $N$'s at these 10 points during evaporation is obtained. However, it would be ideal if we could generate the evolution of $N$ values at any point without doing MALDI measurements on every single sample. In order to achieve this, we first plot the evolution of each $N$ value as a function of evaporation time, based on the number fraction of each $N$ in the products from different points during the evaporation process. Then we fit the ten data points for each $N$ value with Gaussian curves, which enables us to estimate the distribution of all $N$'s at any point during the evaporation (by applying interpolation only) (Figure \ref{fig:Nevolution}), and therefore calculate estimates of $M_{n}$, $M_{w}$, PDI of samples that did not have MALDI performed.
