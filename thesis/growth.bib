abstract = {The kinetic nucleation theory of chain folding, including the effects of reptation, is extended to predict the increase in crystal growth rate G that is implied by measurements on PE and POM at moderately large undercoolings. The increased growth rate denotes the rather abrupt transition from Regime II where G∝i12 to Regime III where G∝ i (i = surface nucleation rate). The distance between the niches on the growth front in Regime II diminishes rapidly with falling crystallization temperature Tx, and approaches the molecular width at a specified undercooling where Regime III begins. In PE, the Regime I → Regime II transition occurs at $\Delta$T ⋍ 16°C, and the Regime II → Regime III transition is predicted to occur at $\Delta$T ∼ 23°C ($\Delta$T based on T°m(∞) = 145°C). Growth rate data on PE and POM crystallized from the melt suggest conformity with the theoretical predictions. The implications of Regime III crystallization to chain morphology are discussed. The kinetic theory, which predicts narrowly spaced niches on the growth front, taken together with the restrictions on the degree of non-adjacent re-entry imposed by the ‘Gambler's Ruin' treatment, leads directly to the ‘variable cluster' model as the relevant morphology in Regime III. Here runs of adjacently chain-folded stems of varying size (averaging about three or so stems) are laid down interspersed with non-adjacent re-entries, leading to a lamellar surface that is about two-thirds ‘regular' or ‘tight' folds, most or all of these representing strictly adjacent re-entries. The steady-state reptation process operative in Regimes I and II in PE is impaired at temperatures just below the inception of Regime III, and it is suggested that at lower temperatures the ‘slack' portions of the chains engage in forming the small clusters of adjacent stems. The variable cluster model leads in a natural way to the amorphous component found in quench-crystallized polymers, and is consistent with neutron scattering data on quench-crystallized PEH-PED.},

abstract = {The rate of growth of chain-folded lamellar crystals from the subcooled melt of polyethylene fractions is treated in terms of surface nucleation theory with the objective of illuminating the origin of the chain folding phenomenon and associated kinetic effects in molecular terms. An updated version of flux-based nucleation theory in readily usable form is outlined that deals with the nature of polymer chains in more detail than previous treatments. The subjects covered include: (i) the origin of regimes I, II, III, and III-A and the associated crystal growth rates, including the effect of forced steady-state reptation and reptation of ‘slack' in the subcooled melt; (ii) the variation of the initial lamellar thickness with undercooling; (iii) the origin of the fold surface free energy $\sigma$e and the lateral surface free energy $\sigma$; (iv) the generation and effect of nonadjacent events (such as tie chains) on the crystallinity and growth rates; and (v) ‘quantized' chain folding at low molecular weight. The topological limitation on nonadjacent re-entry and the value of the apportionment factor $\psi$ are discussed. Key experimental data are analysed in terms of the theory and essential parameters determined, including the size of the substrate length L involved in regime I growth. The degree of adjacent and/or ‘tight' folding that obtains in the kinetically-induced lamellar structures is treated as being a function of molecular weight and undercooling. New evidence based on the quantization effect indicates a high degree of adjacent re-entry in regime I for the lower molecular weight fractions. The quality of the chain folding at higher molecular weights in the various regimes is discussed in terms of kinetic, neutron scattering, i.r., and other evidence. Application of the theory to other polymers is discussed briefly.},

abstract = {A detailed interpretation of the kinetics of homogeneous nucleation and growth of crysLals or a linear homopolymer from dilute solution is given. The probability of forming both nuclei with fold ed chains, and conventional bundlelike nuclei, from dilute solution is analyzed. It is predicted that at sufficiently high dilution, critical nuclei of length 1: will be formed from single polym er molecules by sharp folding of the chain backbone. The step height of the nucleus is given approximately by 1:=4O' ,/A f. Here fI , is the fr ee energy requ ired to form a unit area of the loop-containing end surfaces, and Af is the free energy d ifference per unit volum e of crystal between the crystalline and solution states. The quantity Af is approxim ately proportional to the degree of s upercooling AT. The growth of thesc nuclci is then analyzcd. After growth, the resulting crystal is flat and platelike, the loops formed by the chain folds being on the upper and lower surfaces Kinetic factors d etermine that the distance between the flat slll'faces in the grown crystal will vary over only a narrow range about a value that is in the vicinityofl *=4O' ./Af. (NeglectingefTects du e to edge free encrgies, the theoretical upper and lower limits are l *= 40' ,/ Af and I *= 2O' ,/Af, respccLi vely.) In so me cases the predicted temperature dependence of the step height of the grown crystal, I*= const./ AT, may be modified by the existence of a constant tcrm resulting from thc presence of an edge fr ce cnergy E". A grown loop-type cry tal is predicted to be stable in comparison with a bundlclike crystal of the same shape and volume in a sufficiently diluLe olution. The logarithm of the nucleation rate is approximately proportional to 1/ (A T)2 near the m elting point. The cxponent n in the free growth rate law is predicted under various ass umption s. To the extent that compariso n is possibl e, the predictions givcn agree with the experimental r es ults obtained by K eIJ er and O'Connor an d others on single crystals of unbranched polyethylene grown from dilute solution. A su rvey is given of homogeneo us ll!..! cleaiion in bulk polymers, where the conventional bundlelik e nucleus containing segmenLs from many different molecules is v alid, and the essential results comparcd with thosc calculated for the dilu te solution case. The theory given for loop nuclei is both general and precise enough at the critical points to s uggest that, on crystallization from sufficiently dilute solution, crystals of a definite step height arc commonly to be expect()d for other crystalli zable linear polymers than polyethyl-ene, provid ed loop formation is sterically possible.},

abstract = {We studied the thermodynamic properties of a large ensemble of polymer crystals confined in the spherical cells of a block copolymer mesostructure. Nucleated only at large supercoolings, the resulting highly imperfect crystallites showed significant reorganization upon heating. A broad melting range is caused by the superposition of sharp melting transitions of the individual crystals, which take place at different temperatures corresponding to a multitude of possible metastable states. Thus, at the limit of their stability, individual nanocrystals only have the choice between complete melting or stabilization by reorganization taking place entirely in the crystalline state. As a consequence of their smallness, melting−recrystallization processes within the individual cells are prohibited.},

@article{Cheng2005,
abstract = {In the search for a greater understanding of polymer crystallization, numerous experimental observations with regards to microscopic structures and macroscopic properties have been reported in the past half-century. There are generally two types of experimental results to provide information about the mechanisms of polymer crystal growth, i.e. molecular dynamic/scattering and structural/morphological. Since we cannot follow the trajectory of individual chain molecules when they undergo the transition from liquid to solid state during the crystallization process, structural/morphological analysis of polymer crystals reveal information recorded during this process. Namely, the final structure and morphology of polymer crystals have atomic, stem and global chain conformation information embedded in them during crystallization which provides evidence which can be used to deduce molecular aspects of the polymer crystallization process. It is commonly understood that polymer crystallization, from the thermodynamic perspective, is a first-order transition involving the relaxation of a metastable undercooled melt towards the equilibrium state which is rarely reached in polymer crystals. This process is controlled by a free energy barrier. A molecular model is required to describe the landscape of the free energy barriers and to provide an analytical explanation concerning and predictions about polymer crystallization. The Hoffman–Lauritzen (HL) theory, which was put forward more than 40 years ago, was one of the first analytical theories to illustrate how polymers crystallize. Since then, modifications to the HL theory and suggestions for new approaches have been reported, but the core physical picture of the HL theory has largely remained intact. This article consists of four major parts: (1) we will compare the crystallization of small molecules and long chain molecules, and the relationship between crystallization and crystal habits. The diversity of crystalline structures and morphologies of semi-crystalline polymers must be taken into account when studying the crystallization mechanism of polymers (2) this article also serves as a brief review of the HL theory and its importance in our understanding of polymer crystallization (3) we have tried to answer the question: what is the nucleation barrier? Specifically, we will illustrate that the nucleation barrier in polymer crystallization consists of both enthalpic and entropic components as deduced from experimental results. This barrier, from our perspective, consists of selection processes taking place in different length- and time-scales (4) finally, there is a brief discussion on what issues remain, in particular, in the areas of undercooled liquid structures and the initial stages of crystallization.},

abstract = {The solvent transport in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and related phenomena were investigated. Based on Harmon's model for Case I (Fickian), Case II (swelling) and anomalous transport, the data of mass uptake were analyzed. Pure Case I or Case II behavior did not appear in our study and is affected by the annealing atmospheres and the preheating environments. The mass transport in PET is accompanied by a large-scale structural rearrangement, which leads to the induced crystallization of the original amorphous state. During this process, the matrix is under compressive stress. Solvent-induced crystallization was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), which is quite different from the thermal crystallization. The different behaviors of sorption between the solvent-treated PET crystallites and thermally treated PET can be explained in terms of the results of XRD, DSC and density measurement.},

abstract = {Characteristic features of isothermal growth, thickening, and melting behavior of melt grown single crystals of low molecular weight poly (ethylene oxide) fractions are presented and discussed in terms of their relevance to basic concepts of polymer crystal growth. Measurements of growth (G) and thickening rates of once folded chain crystals were extended (up to the melting point) into a temperature range where usually only extended chain crystals grow. Monolayer extended and folded chain crystals melt by lateral shrinkage, the rate of which (G−) depends not only on temperature, but also on thermal history. G− increases exponentially with the degree of superheating, and the value of the temperature coefficient d log G−/dT is proportional to the lamellar thickness. In the narrow temperature interval where transition from once folded to extended chain growth occurs, the crystal morphology displays some spectacular features. These may be accounted for in terms of the crystal habit and the rate of completion, g. of a molecular layer in the particular (hk0) prism face considered. Morphological analysis shows that g is of the same order of magnitude as G(hkO), leading to the conclusion that the growth of these PEO crystals is controlled by multiple surface nucleation rather than by deposition of a single surface nucleus.},

abstract = {This chapter includes a survey of some of the experimental methods that are available for the study of polymer nucleation and crystallization. The physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of crystalline polymers depend on the morphology of the crystals formed and the degree of crystallinity of the sample. The primary crystallization process, nucleation controlled, consists of the formation of lamellae, radiating outward and branching in such a fashion that the overall crystal density of the growing structure remains nearly constant. In some cases, the ribbonlike lamellae become twisted as they grow, giving rise to the spectacular ringed spherulites. In this chapter, the focus is on description and evaluation of the experimental methods rather than surveying the results obtained for individual polymers by different techniques. The study of crystallization in bulk samples is emphasized. A discussion is presented on crystallization from solution to some extent. Information concerning the underlying theory is provided along with the method for analyzing the results of each type of experiment. A general background on semicrystalline polymers is presented.

Solvent-induced crystallization can occur during the transport process in PET at low temperature. The important effect of changing the surrounding medium to solvent molecules is to reduce the glass transition temperature. This phenomenon is called “plasticization”. The extent of plasticization relies on the amount of solvent around the polymer molecules, i.e., the concentration of solvent which will depend on the mass transport before saturation. Evidences for the transport mechanism in the first stage of crystallization were revealed. The distinct diffusion front was determined from the measurements of optical microscope and microhardness.

abstract = {It is the aim of this article to review the major theories of polymer crystallization since up to now we still have not completely comprehended the underlying mechanism in a unified framework. A lack of paradigm is an indicator of immaturity of the field itself; thus, the fundamental issue of polymer crystallization remains unsolved. This paper provides an understanding of the basic hypothesis, as well as relevant physical implications and consequences of each theory without too much bias. We try to present the essential aspects of the major theories, and intuitive physical arguments over rigorously mathematical calculations are highlighted. In addition, a detailed comparison of various theories will be made in a logical and self-contained fashion. Our personal view of the existing theories is presented as well, aiming to inspire further open discussions. We expect that new theories based on the framework of kinetics with direct consideration of long-range multi-body correlation will help solve the remaining problems in the field of polymer crystallization.},

abstract = {Polymer physics is a key part of macromolecular science. This textbook presents the elements of this important branch of materials science in the style of a series of lecture. The main focus lays on the concepts, rather than on experimental techniques and theoretical methods. Written for graduate students of physics, materials science and chemical engineering, as well as for researchers in academia and industry entering this field, the book introduces and discusses the basic phenomena that lead to the peculiar physical properties of polymeric systems. After more than ten years since the first printing, the time had come for a revision and expansion of the book's contents. In addition to numerous minor modifications, this third edition includes some major changes: (i) A newly written chapter deals with conjugated polymers. The physical basis of the characteristic electro-optic response is explained, and the spectacular electrical conduction properties of conjugated polymers created by doping are discussed. (ii) Polyelectrolyte solutions with their special properties caused by Coulomb forces are newly treated in different chapters of the book dealing with ordering phenomena, viscous effects and the superswelling of gels. (iii) Since the basic understanding of melt crystallization has greatly changed during the last decade, the corresponding chapter was rewritten. It presents the new findings and interprets the discovered laws.},

abstract = {A syst ematic study of t h e problem of spherulitic growth in linear polymers in bulk has been carried out. A calculation of the radial growth of polymer spherulites is given for four models. These concern growth where the surface nuclei t hat control th e r a te a re (1) bundle-like and coherent, (2) chain fold ed and coherent, (3) chain fold ed and noncoherent, a nd (4) bundlelike a nd non coher en t. The required mod ifi cations of nucleation theory fir e given. Then the radial growth rate laws are derived for each model, and the type of "spherulite" t hat would be formed discussed. The model with chain fo lded and coherent growth nuclei leads to a typical lamellar spherulite. The properti es of the ind ividual chain folded lamellae that form the spherulite are predicted, including the change of step h eight with growth t emperature, m elting behavior, and the behavior on r ecrys talliza t ion. (Chain folded lamellae may a lso occur in sp ecimens t hat are not obviously spherulitic.) Under certain condition , the noncohcrent model with chain folds can lead to a mod ified la m ellar spherulite. None of t he bundlelike models will lead to a typical lamellar spheru li te, though a spherical microcryst alline obje ct might be formed. It is concluded that lamellar spherulites consist largely of chain fold ed structures. The fa ctors tha t could cause chain folded crystals to appear in profus ion in bulk polymers are discussed. The case of homogeneous initiation is considered first. Homogeneous initiation of chain folded nuclei in bulk will prev ail if the end s urface free energy of the bundJelike nucleus exceeds that of the folded. It is shown that the end s urface free energy of the bundle-like nuc le us, as calculated with a den sity grad ient model, will be larger t han h a d bee n s up-posed previously. It is therefore considered to be theore t ically possible th a t the end s urface free energy of the bundlelike nucle us may in some cases exceed t hat of the folded nucle us. Attention is given to the possibility th a t folded structures appear in large numbers beca use cumulative strain or large chain ends prevent th e growth of bund lelik e nuclei to la rge si ze, e ven when the latter type of nucle us is energetically favored when small. H e terogen eous initia tion of fold ed structures is then considered. Other topics m entioned include: (1) Condi tions that might lead to nonlamellar or non-spherulitic crystalli zation in bulk, (2) t he origin of the twi t that is frequ ently exhibited by t he lamellae in spherulites, (3) the transitions that may sometimes occur in the rad ial growth r a te law, and (4) interla mellar link.

abstract = {The kinetic theory of the rate of growth G and the initial lamellar thickness lg* of chain‐folded crystals is extended so that it is applicable at high undercoolings. Attention is centered on the details of how the first step element and the first fold are put down on the substrate. A parameter $\phi$ that varies between zero and unity, which apportions the free energy of attachment of the step element between the forward and backward reactions, is used to denote variations in this process. Expressions for G are derived from flux equations for two limiting cases: regime I, single surface nucleation act with rapid substrate completion and regime II, numerous surface nucleation acts with very slow substrate completion. Data from the literature on G for isotactic polystyrene (regime II) and polyethylene single crystals (regime I) are analyzed to obtain surface free energies, and these are used with the revised theory for lg* to predict the lamellar thickness of these polymers. Good agreement between lg* and publi...},
