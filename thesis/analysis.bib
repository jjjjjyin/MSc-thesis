abstract = {A small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) study was conducted on melt-crystallized long-chain n-alkanes C162H326, C194H390 and C246H494. The main objective was to clarify the structure of lamellar crystals with the layer period a non-integer fraction (NIF) of the period of extended-chain crystals; the NIF form is the product of primary chain-folded melt crystallization (Ungar, G. and Keller, A., Polymer, 1986, 27, 1835) and it transforms subsequently to one of the integer folded forms. The extended-chain form crystallized from melt was also studied. Electron density profiles along the layer normal were reconstructed by inverse Fourier transformation using discrete diffraction intensities. The profiles were compared with the data computed from models. The best fitting models consist of alternating high- and low-density layers with relatively sharp boundaries. The high-density layers, representing the crystalline regions, have thicknesses which closely match either the calculated thickness of extended-chain layers with 35° chain tilt (for the extended-chain form) or half that value (for the NIF form). In the extended-chain form a low density intercrystalline layer is observed with thickness between 1 and 3nm, depending on chain length and temperature. In contrast, the non-crystalline layer in the NIF form is 6 to 8nm thick. It has constant density and is truly amorphous, as indicated by the close match between SAXS and DSC crystallinities, which are less than two thirds for the as-formed NIF structure. While less than half the chains are folded in the latter structure, those that have a fold in the middle (`integer folding'). Non-folded chains traverse the crystal layer only once, while their uncrystallized ends (cilia) comprise the amorphous layer. Within the crystalline layer of the NIF form chains are tilted at 35°. The fraction of folded, fully crystallized chains increases with decreasing temperature at the expense of the amorphous layer, resulting in a reduction in amorphous layer thickness and overall lamellar periodicity (lamellar `thinning').},

The work focuses on the design of experiments, synthesis and characterization of poly(trimethylene terephthalate)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PTT-b-PEO) copolymers as CO2-philic membrane materials. The statistical analysis of experimental data, data fitting to mathematical models, as well as the optimization of CO2permeability is discussed. By these means we synthesized optimal materials with promising CO2separation performance (CO2permeability=183-200Barrer and CO2/N2selectivity {\textgreater}50); they are also promising because the synthesis is simple, highly reproducible and might be scalable for producing on large volumes. Thus, these new and tailored polymers might have potential applications as membrane material for CO2-capture. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Although macromonomers and telechelics are oligomers, all three terms can be distinguished from one another by the functionality of their chain ends, and by the nature of the products resulting from the reactions of their chains ends. An oligomer does not necessarily contain any reactive end groups. However, the reactive chain ends are statistically distributed if present, such as in oligomers of condensation polymerizations. A telechelic is an oligomer containing at least one reactive end group, while a macromonomer is generally considered to be an oligomer containing at least one homopolymerizable end group. In contrast, the end groups of a telechelic may undergo chain extension through either condensation polymerization (dicarboxylic, dihydroxylic groups, etc.), addition reactions (e.g. hydrosilation of vinylic groups), or by ring-opening reactions (heterocyclic end groups such as the reaction of glicidyl ethers with carboxylic groups).},

@article{Jaeger1998,
abstract = {The first classification of general types of transition between phases of matter, introduced by Paul Ehrenfest in 1933, lies at a crossroads in the thermodynamical study of critical phenomena. It arose following the discovery in 1932 of a suprising new phase transition in liquid helium, the "lambda transition," when W. H. Keesom and coworkers in Leiden, Holland observed a lambda-shaped "jump" discontinuity in the curve giving the temperature dependence of the specific heat of helium at a critical value. This apparent jump led Ehrenfest to introduce a classification of phase transitions on the basis of jumps in derivatives of the free energy function. This classification was immediately applied by A.J. Rutgers to the study of the transition from the normal to superconducting state in metals. Eduard Justi and Max von Laue soon questioned the possibility of its class of "second-order phase transitions" - of which the "lambda transition was believed to be the arche type - but C.J. Gorter and H.B.G. Casimir used an "order parameter to demonstrate their existence in superconductors. As a crossroads of study, the Ehrenfest classification was forced to undergo a slow, adaptive evolution during subsequent decades. During the 1940's the classification was increasingly used in discussions of liquid-gas, order-disorder, paramagnetic-ferromagnetic and normal-super-conducting phase transitions. Already in 1944 however, Lars Onsager's solution of the Ising model for two-dimensional magnets was seen to possess a derivative with a logarithmic divergence rather than a jump as the critical point was approached. In the 1950's, experiments further revealed the lambda transition in helium to exhibit similar behavior. Rather than being a prime example of an Ehrenfest phase transition, the...

abstract = {Blends of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) as well as the respective diblock copolymers PEO-b-PMA form a homogeneous melt and undergo. crystallization of PEO upon cooling. Although an identical PEO (M-n = 5000 g/mol) is used in blends and diblock copolymers, crystallization and melting behavior at comparable PMA contents differs strongly as revealed by temperature-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. After isothermal crystallization, PEO lamellae in the blends thicken during heating from once-folded to extended chain crystals prior to melting as revealed by TR-SAKS. Contrarily, in PEO-b-PMA a thickening to extended chain lamellae is impossible when the PMA block exceeds an M of about 3000 g/mol. This behavior is caused by a balance between the tendency of the crystallizable block to form extended chain crystals, the tendency of the noncrystallizable chains to adopt a maximum in conformational entropy, and the space requirements of the these chains at the crystalline amorphous interface. Thus, chain-folded crystals of PEO are formed as a compromise when the noncrystallizable chains become sufficiently long and can be considered to be in thermodynamic equilibrium. Equilibrium melting temperatures for neat PEO, T-m(0), and for PEO in blends and diblock copolymers, T-m,b(0), are determined using both the Hoffman-Weeks and the Gibbs-Thomson approach. Values determined by the Hoffman-Weeks method are generally lower compared to values obtained by the Gibbs Thomson approach, which can be explained by inherent differences in extrapolation procedures. The maximum equilibrium melting point depression T-m(0) - T-m,b(0) is found to be 2 K in blends and 7 K in diblock copolymers. In the case of blends, melting point depression can be explained by Flory's entropy contribution of miscible polymer blends.},

abstract = {Characteristic features of isothermal growth, thickening, and melting behavior of melt grown single crystals of low molecular weight poly (ethylene oxide) fractions are presented and discussed in terms of their relevance to basic concepts of polymer crystal growth. Measurements of growth (G) and thickening rates of once folded chain crystals were extended (up to the melting point) into a temperature range where usually only extended chain crystals grow. Monolayer extended and folded chain crystals melt by lateral shrinkage, the rate of which (G−) depends not only on temperature, but also on thermal history. G− increases exponentially with the degree of superheating, and the value of the temperature coefficient d log G−/dT is proportional to the lamellar thickness. In the narrow temperature interval where transition from once folded to extended chain growth occurs, the crystal morphology displays some spectacular features. These may be accounted for in terms of the crystal habit and the rate of completion, g. of a molecular layer in the particular (hk0) prism face considered. Morphological analysis shows that g is of the same order of magnitude as G(hkO), leading to the conclusion that the growth of these PEO crystals is controlled by multiple surface nucleation rather than by deposition of a single surface nucleus.},

abstract = {Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are well known as excipients in tablet dosage formulations. PEGs are generally known to be inert and have very few interactions with other components in the solid dosage forms. However, the physical nature of PEGs and how they affect the disintegration of tablets is not very well understood for the different molecular weights of PEGs. The knowledge of the effect of molecular weight of PEGs on their physical properties and the effect of humidity on the physical properties of PEGs are important parameters for the choice of a PEG to be acceptable as an excipient in pharmaceutical formulations. This study was done to determine the precision of the DSC physical properties for a wide range of PEGs with varying molecular weights from 194 to 23000 daltons. Nine different molecular weights of PEGs were examined in a DSC controlled Heat-Cool-Heat-Cool-Heat (HCHCH) cycle and the observed reproducible values of melting temperature, heat of fusion, crystallization temperature and the heat of crystallization were compared with values obtained from the literature and the observed percent crystallinity was again cross-checked by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) studies. The comparison values indicated acceptable precision. This study was also done to check the effect of humidity on the DSC physical properties for the entire range of PEGs. The results indicated that humidity probably has a higher effect on the physical properties of the low molecular weight PEGs as compared to the high molecular weight PEGs.},

abstract = {Abstract The morphology and orientation of a number of polymers as crystallized from solution was studied with the electron microscope combined with selected area electron diffraction. In the course of this work single crystals could be prepared which were most striking in the case of straight chain polyethylenes. There is evidence among others, that the fibrillar (sheaf-type, spherulitic) crystallization, characteristic of polymers, develops through formation of flat single crystals. The single crystals contain screw dislocations and grow by spiral terraces. The observed orientation and the minimum thickness of the crystals leads to the inescapable conclusion that the molecules must bend sharply back on themselves forming a regular folded configuration. Accordingly the strength of the dislocation, consequently the height of growth step, would correspond to the distance between successive bends. Various other observations are consistent with this new concept.},

Analyses of neutron scattering functions for deuterated polyethylene and polypropylene chains dispersed with the corresponding protonated host in the melt and co-crystallized therewith show that adjacent re-entry occurs infrequently. The highly entangled topological relationships of chains that exist in the melt must be retained, in large measure, in the semicrystalline state. Crystallization from dilute solution is concluded to involve participation of a number of chains competing for deposition at growth kinks. High molecular weight chains in these solution-grown crystals are thus distributed in a number of neighbouring growth layers, the crystalline stems being connected predominantly by non-adjacent folds.},

The subsequent crystal growth process is characterized by a sliding-in motion of the chains.

abstract = {The isothermal melt crystallization of the long pure n-alkanes, C150H302, C198H398, and C246H494, was studied by phase contrast and polarized optical microscopy. A custom-built T-jump cell was used. The crystal growth rates of CtsoH302, C198H398, and C246H494, and the rate of primary nucleation of C246H494 were measured directly. Both the growth and nucleation rates of crystals of C246H494 pass through a pronounced maximum and minimum with increasing supercooling. This unusual finding is in line with our previous observations of qualitatively the same behaviour of the overall crystallization rate of the alkanes C246H494 and C198H398 from both melt and solution. The rate minimum coincides with the transition between extended and once-folded chain crystallization. The slow down in nucleation and growth of extended-chain crystals is thought to be due to interference by frequent but unstable chain-folded depositions (surface 'self-poisoning'). Due to the high crystallization rates and experimental limitations, measurements could not be made at supercoolings which were sufficiently large to observe the minimum in CI50H302 and C198H398, although an indication of the maximum is noticed in C198H398. In the vicinity of the extended-chain melting point the crystal growth rate G increases linearly with the increasing supercooling 85 AT. The dependence of the slope on the molecular length l could be approximated by dG/d(AT) e{\textless} l " for the three alkanes studied here. The morphological features, as well as the differences between growth and nucleation kinetics, are discussed.},

abstract = {It is the aim of this article to review the major theories of polymer crystallization since up to now we still have not completely comprehended the underlying mechanism in a unified framework. A lack of paradigm is an indicator of immaturity of the field itself; thus, the fundamental issue of polymer crystallization remains unsolved. This paper provides an understanding of the basic hypothesis, as well as relevant physical implications and consequences of each theory without too much bias. We try to present the essential aspects of the major theories, and intuitive physical arguments over rigorously mathematical calculations are highlighted. In addition, a detailed comparison of various theories will be made in a logical and self-contained fashion. Our personal view of the existing theories is presented as well, aiming to inspire further open discussions. We expect that new theories based on the framework of kinetics with direct consideration of long-range multi-body correlation will help solve the remaining problems in the field of polymer crystallization.},

abstract = {Abstract The morphology and orientation of a number of polymers as crystallized from solution was studied with the electron microscope combined with selected area electron diffraction. In the course of this work single crystals could be prepared which were most striking in the case of straight chain polyethylenes. There is evidence among others, that the fibrillar (sheaf-type, spherulitic) crystallization, characteristic of polymers, develops through formation of flat single crystals. The single crystals contain screw dislocations and grow by spiral terraces. The observed orientation and the minimum thickness of the crystals leads to the inescapable conclusion that the molecules must bend sharply back on themselves forming a regular folded configuration. Accordingly the strength of the dislocation, consequently the height of growth step, would correspond to the distance between successive bends. Various other observations are consistent with this new concept.},

abstract = {Characteristic features of isothermal growth, thickening, and melting behavior of melt grown single crystals of low molecular weight poly (ethylene oxide) fractions are presented and discussed in terms of their relevance to basic concepts of polymer crystal growth. Measurements of growth (G) and thickening rates of once folded chain crystals were extended (up to the melting point) into a temperature range where usually only extended chain crystals grow. Monolayer extended and folded chain crystals melt by lateral shrinkage, the rate of which (G−) depends not only on temperature, but also on thermal history. G− increases exponentially with the degree of superheating, and the value of the temperature coefficient d log G−/dT is proportional to the lamellar thickness. In the narrow temperature interval where transition from once folded to extended chain growth occurs, the crystal morphology displays some spectacular features. These may be accounted for in terms of the crystal habit and the rate of completion, g. of a molecular layer in the particular (hk0) prism face considered. Morphological analysis shows that g is of the same order of magnitude as G(hkO), leading to the conclusion that the growth of these PEO crystals is controlled by multiple surface nucleation rather than by deposition of a single surface nucleus.},

abstract = {Novel polyethylene oxide (PEO) hydrogel films were synthesized via UV crosslinking with varying concentrations of pentaerythritol tetra-acrylate (PETRA) as crosslinking agent. The aim was to study the effects of the crosslinking agent on the material properties of hydrogel films intended for dermatological applications. Fabricated film samples were characterized using swelling studies, scanning electron microscopy, tensile testing and rheometry. Films showed rapid swelling and high elasticity. The increase of PETRA concentration resulted in significant increase in the gel fraction and crosslinking density ($\rho$c), while causing a significant decrease in the equilibrium water content (EWC), average molecular weight between crosslinks ($\backslash$({\{}$\backslash$overline{\{}M{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}c{\}}$\backslash$)), and mesh size ($\zeta$) of films. From the scanning electron microscopy, cross-linked PEO hydrogel network appeared as cross-linked mesh-like structure with interconnected micropores. Rheological studies showed PEO films required a minimum of 2.5{\%} w/w PETRA to form stable viscoelastic solid gels. Preliminary studies concluded that a minimum of 2.5{\%} w/w PETRA is required to yield films with desirable properties for skin application.},

abstract = {The review summarizes current trends and developments in the polymer-ization of alkylene oxides in the last two decades since 1995, with a particular focus on the most important epoxide monomers ethylene oxide (EO), propylene oxide (PO), and butylene oxide (BO). Classical synthetic pathways, i.e., anionic polymerization, coordination polymerization, and cationic polymerization of epoxides (oxiranes), are briefly reviewed. The main focus of the review lies on more recent and in some cases metal-free methods for epoxide polymerization, i.e., the activated monomer strategy, the use of organocatalysts, such as N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and N-heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) as well as phosphazene bases. In addition, the commercially relevant double-metal cyanide (DMC) catalyst systems are discussed. Besides the synthetic progress, new types of multifunctional linear PEG (mf-PEG) and PPO structures accessible by copolymerization of EO or PO with functional epoxide comonomers are presented as well as complex branched, hyperbranched, and dendrimer like polyethers. Amphiphilic block copolymers based on PEO and PPO (Poloxamers and Pluronics) and advances in the area of PEGylation as the most important bioconjugation strategy are also summarized. With the ever growing toolbox for epoxide polymerization, a "polyether universe" may be envisaged that in its structural diversity parallels the immense variety of structural options available for polymers based on vinyl monomers with a purely carbon-based backbone.},

abstract = {Polarized infrared spectra of polyethylene oxide (PEO), —(CH2CH2O) n — and PEO‐d 4, —(CD2CD2O) n —, have been measured in the region from 4000 to 80 cm—1. The spectra of PEO at various temperatures (about —130°, 20°, 65°, and 80°C) were also observed, and splittings of some perpendicular bands were found at the low temperature. The selection rules for the PEO molecule are derived under the factor group D(4$\pi$/7). The normal vibrations of PEO and PEO‐d 4 are calculated for the Raman‐active A 1 symmetry species, the infrared‐active A 2 species, and the Raman‐ and infrared‐active E 1 species, by use of the GFmatrix method with the Urey—Bradley force field taking into account the torsional displacement coordinates of the skeleton. The results show fairly good agreement between the observed and calculated frequencies, and give strong support to the 72 helix conformation proposed by the authors previously. The assignments of the bands are given and discussed.},

abstract = {Various linear hydrocarbons in nature such as n-alkanes are usually found as mixtures of molecules of various chain-lengths. Molecular mechanisms of self-organization and underlying molecular motions in the mixtures are of great scientific and technological interest. By molecular dynamics simulations we here study crystallization in mixtures and diffusion in crystals in multicomponent systems of n-alkanes C n H 2nþ2 (abbreviated as C n): binary mixtures of C 10 eC 20 , a tertiary mixture of C 10 eC 14 eC 20 , and a qua-ternary mixture of C 10 eC 14 eC 20 eC 25. We find clear phase-separated crystallization in the binary mixtures of C 10 and C 20 , the phase diagram and the texture of which correspond well to the eutectic ones inferred from experiments. On the other hand, the tertiary mixture is found to show rather uniform co-crystallization but with nanoscale domains made of single species of molecules. We find that the domains of closer chain-lengths tend to be adjacent while those of distant chain-lengths prefer to be separated in space; the inclination to demix for the chains of distinct lengths is found to be mediated by the intervention of chains of in-between lengths acting as compatibilizers. Similar mechanism is found operative in the quaternary system also. Through detailed investigations of the molecular dynamics in the tertiary mixture, we find novel modes of long-range diffusion in the crystal. The diffusive motions parallel to the chain axis are essentially two steps of molecular escape from a lamella followed by reentry into the neighboring lamella. On the other hand, the chain motions perpendicular to the chain axis are found to be of quite unexpected three steps; escape from a lamella followed by diffusion in the inter-lamellar region and reentry into the lamella.},

abstract = {A new method to determine the correct Gibbs−Thomson plot and equilibrium melting temperature (Tm0) of polymers was proposed. The Gibbs−Thomson plot method is reliable, because the Gibbs−Thomson equation is directly derived from thermodynamical relations. In this method, the heating rate dependence of melting temperature (Tm) was omitted by applying the theory of the “melting kinetics”, and the effect of lamellar thickening on Tm was also omitted by observing thick lamellae. A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used for observation of Tm as a conventional method. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe a distribution of lamellar thickness (l). It was shown theoretically that peak temperature of melting endotherm (Tm(DSC)) corresponded to averaged reciprocal l (〈l-1〉) for the case of sharp distributions of Tm and l-1. The Gibbs−Thomson plot, Tm (DSC) vs 〈l-1〉, was carried out. A reliable Gibbs−Thomson plot and Tm0 = 186.2 °C were obtained for a fraction of isotactic polypropylene...},

Written for graduate students of physics, materials science and chemical engineering, as well as for researchers in academia and industry entering this field, the book introduces and discusses the basic phenomena that lead to the peculiar physical properties of polymeric systems. After more than ten years since the first printing, the time had come for a revision and expansion of the book's contents. In addition to numerous minor modifications, this third edition includes some major changes: (i) A newly written chapter deals with conjugated polymers. The physical basis of the characteristic electro-optic response is explained, and the spectacular electrical conduction properties of conjugated polymers created by doping are discussed. (ii) Polyelectrolyte solutions with their special properties caused by Coulomb forces are newly treated in different chapters of the book dealing with ordering phenomena, viscous effects and the superswelling of gels. (iii) Since the basic understanding of melt crystallization has greatly changed during the last decade, the corresponding chapter was rewritten. It presents the new findings and interprets the discovered laws.},

abstract = {Two available theories of melting in extended chain polymer crystals are critically examined and compared with calorimetric data. Melting points, T m , and enthalpy of fusion, $\Delta$H, have been measured for extended-chain crystals of poly(ethylene-oxide) fractions, covering a wide range of molecular weights. It appears that the theory of Flory and Vrij is the most appropriate to describe the present results and literature data. Application of this theory to experiments yields T m (∞) = (68.9 ± 0.4) °C and suggests that the value of the surface free energy, $\sigma$ e , lies within 0.34 and 0.81 Kcal/mole, its enthalpic part ($\Delta$H e /2) being (4.18 ± 0.22) Kcal/mole. Such a low value of $\sigma$ e may be attributed to hydrogen bonding of OH end-groups located in the disordered surface layer of closely stacked crystalline lamellae.},

abstract = {Abstraet--Nonaethylene glycol and pentadecaethylene glycol and their dimethyl ethers have been pre-pared and characterized, with respect to crystallinity by wide-and small-angle X-ray scattering, Raman scattering, i.r. spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Wide-angle X-ray scattering is similar to that from high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide). The crystal habit is lamella. The lamellae are highly crystalline and the surface layers are ordered. Comparison with crystalline poly(ethylene oxide) prepared conventionally, and having a distribution of chain lengths, shows that such samples crystallize into lamellae with disordered surface layers.},
