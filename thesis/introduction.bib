@article{Fox1950a,
abstract = {Dilatometric and viscometric data on fractionated polystyrenes containing diethylbenzene end groups are presented over wide temperature ranges. The second‐order transition temperature, viscosity‐temperature coefficient, and specific volume all change rapidly with increasing molecular weight toward asymptotic limits which are practically reached at M≅30,000. Empirical expressions are presented relating these properties to molecular weight and temperature. In each case the dependence on molecular weight is expressed as a simple function of M̄n−1. These observations are interpreted and correlated on the basis of the hypothesis that the local configurational order in a liquid polymer is disturbed by the introduction of end groups to a degree that is proportional to their number. The second‐order transition does not represent an isoviscous state. The internal local configurational structure appears to be equivalent, and independent of temperature, in all polystyrenes below their second‐order transition tempera...},

@incollection{Buckley1975,
abstract = {Two available theories of melting in extended chain polymer crystals are critically examined and compared with calorimetric data. Melting points, T m , and enthalpy of fusion, $\Delta$H, have been measured for extended-chain crystals of poly(ethylene-oxide) fractions, covering a wide range of molecular weights. It appears that the theory of Flory and Vrij is the most appropriate to describe the present results and literature data. Application of this theory to experiments yields T m (∞) = (68.9 ± 0.4) °C and suggests that the value of the surface free energy, $\sigma$ e , lies within 0.34 and 0.81 Kcal/mole, its enthalpic part ($\Delta$H e /2) being (4.18 ± 0.22) Kcal/mole. Such a low value of $\sigma$ e may be attributed to hydrogen bonding of OH end-groups located in the disordered surface layer of closely stacked crystalline lamellae.},

@article{Brady2017,
abstract = {In many respects, polymeric materials have a preeminent position among excipients, as they form the backbone of modern pharmaceutical formulation practice and drug delivery technologies in particular. With the exception of a few technologies, the majority of bioavailability enhancement, modified-release, and controlled-release technologies rely on the unique properties of polymers to achieve drug-release control through a variety of mechanisms. Polymeric excipients are numerous and very diverse of natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic origin, depending on the source and method of preparation. They can also be classified alternatively according to their chemical composition, chain shape, comonomer sequence, and their performance. Our objective is to provide the user and formulator of polymeric excipients an operational and practical guide upon which to base rational formulation decisions and understand the molecular origins of polymer performance and structure- property relationships. The chapter delves into the fundamentals and measurement of foundational polymer compositional, structural, and property traits. Additionally the importance of structure- property relationships in modern formulation development is highlighted with numerous practical examples. The chapter concludes with a broad overview of the major classes of natural, semisynthetic and synthetic pharmaceutical polymers.},

@article{Xue2015,
abstract = {Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) based materials are widely considered as promising candidates of polymer hosts in solid-state electrolytes for high energy density secondary lithium batteries. They have several specific advantages such as high safety, easy fabrication, low cost, high energy density, good electrochemical stability, and excellent compatibility with lithium salts. However, the typical linear PEO does not meet the production requirement because of its insufficient ionic conductivity due to the high crystallinity of the ethylene oxide (EO) chains, which can restrain the ionic transition due to the stiff structure especially at low temperature. Scientists have explored different approaches to reduce the crystallinity and hence to improve the ionic conductivity of PEO-based electrolytes, including blending, modifying and making PEO derivatives. This review is focused on surveying the recent developments and issues concerning PEO-based electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries.},
