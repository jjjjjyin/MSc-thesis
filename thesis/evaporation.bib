abstract = {To predict atmospheric partitioning of organic compounds between gas and aerosol particle phase based on explicit models for gas phase chemistry, saturation vapor pressures of the compounds need to be estimated. Estimation methods based on functional group contributions require training sets of compounds with well-established saturation vapor pressures. However, vapor pressures of semivolatile and low-volatility organic molecules at atmospheric temperatures reported in the literature often differ by several orders of magnitude between measurement techniques. These discrepancies exceed the stated uncertainty of each technique which is generally reported to be smaller than a factor of 2. At present, there is no general reference technique for measuring saturation vapor pressures of atmospherically relevant compounds with low vapor pressures at atmospheric temperatures. To address this problem, we measured vapor pressures with different techniques over a wide temperature range for intercomparison and to establish a reliable training set. We determined saturation vapor pressures for the homologous series of polyethylene glycols (H−(O−CH 2 −CH 2) n −OH) for n = 3 to n = 8 ranging in vapor pressure at 298 K from 10 −7 to 5 × 10 −2 Pa and compare them with quantum chemistry calculations. Such a ho-mologous series provides a reference set that covers several orders of magnitude in saturation vapor pressure, allowing a critical assessment of the lower limits of detection of vapor pressures for the different techniques as well as permitting the identification of potential sources of systematic error. Also, internal consistency within the series allows outlying data to be rejected more easily. Most of the measured vapor pressures agreed within the stated uncertainty range. Deviations mostly occurred for vapor pressure values approaching the lower detection limit of a technique. The good agreement between the measurement techniques (some of which are sensitive to the mass accommodation coefficient and some not) suggests that the mass accommodation coefficients of the studied compounds are close to unity. The quantum chemistry calculations were about 1 order of magnitude higher than the measurements. We find that extrapola-tion of vapor pressures from elevated to atmospheric temperatures is permissible over a range of about 100 K for these compounds, suggesting that measurements should be performed best at temperatures yielding the highest-accuracy data, allowing subsequent extrapolation to atmospheric temperatures .},

@article{Sanchez1976,
abstract = {A molecular theory of classical fluids based on a well-defined statistical mechanical model is presented. Since the model fluid reduces to the classical lattice gas in one special case, it can be best characterized as an Ising or lattice fluid. The model fluid undergoes a liquid-vapor transition. Only three molecular parameters are required to describe a fluid; these parameters have been determined and tabulated for several fluids. The molecular weight dependence of the critical point and boiling point of a homologous series of fluids such as the normal alkanes is correctly predicted,‘ The equation of state does not satisfy a simple corresponding states principle, although polymeric liquids of sufficiently high molecular weight do satisfy a corresponding states principle. The Ising fluid better correlates experimental saturated vapor pressures and liquid-vapor densities than the van der Waals or related theories. When applied to polymeric liquids it correlates experimental density data as well as less tractable equations derived from cell theories. The basic simplicity and structure of the theory readily suggests a generalization to mixtures.},
